<blockquote>
  <p>The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.<br />
- Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The so-called field of computer science is in its infancy. When you stop to think, how many of the sciences have <em>science</em> in their name? Physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology, economics.. none are self-described as <em>science</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because <em>Computer Science</em> is such a new field? What if, instead, we’re not ready for a <em>science</em> of computers? [Herb Simon, “The Sciences of the Artificial”]</p>

<h1 id="by-way-of-analogy">By way of analogy</h1>

<p>A science of computers - what does that even mean? What other sciences claim their focus to be a single instance of a larger theme? Where would physics be if it were coined <em>Object Movement Science</em> or <em>Lens Science</em> prior to the atomic or quantum mechanical field models? An apt metaphor is possibly the jump from alchemy to a true chemistry - from recipe books to models for understanding the arrangement and behavior of molecules.</p>

<p>Great advances in humanity are made when there is a common language, a common shared understanding and mental model, at critical mass. I feel[1] computer science has grown increasingly pointed and more importantly increasingly distant and polarized from the intuition of members who practice a software craft. By no means am I suggesting tossing out the last 50 - 70 years. However, if we generally agree that a promising modern advance is that a fruitful science feeds useful models and language into a fruitful engineering then computer science is falling short of propelling the art of computation.[2]</p>

<p>[1] Maybe this could be substantiated somehow?
[2] Sure the state of the art will always lag behind the frontier of a science but the shared models and language will resonate.</p>

<h1 id="why-philosophy">Why philosophy</h1>

<p>Philosophy in today’s post-modern, pop-cultural age is often misunderstood as an approach.</p>

<p>Simply, philosophy aims to provide a framework for general and fundamental topics. A common way to think about and discuss subjects such as reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know who discovered water but it certainly wasn’t a fish.<br />
- Marshall Mcluhan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that all of us were born into either a modern or post-modern world overrun by western thought, it’s easy to “forget” [3] that the precursor to a rigorous understanding of a subject is the need to be able to talk <em>about</em> the topic in a common way. We also tend to forget that for far longer than we’ve had <em>biology</em>, we had <em>natural philosophy</em>[4,5] laying the foundation for how we might go about studying the natural world, coming up with rigorous ways our minds might organize the information (e.g. taxonomies, models and language to discuss of the <em>order of</em> things in the natural world).</p>

<p>[3] Unless you’re deeply into post-modernist theory.

[5] Aristotle was a much a “proto-biologist” as he was a philosopher and logician / mathematician.</p>

<h1 id="why-not-a-math--science-from-the-start">Why not a math / science from the start?</h1>

<p>Other than Herb Simon’s *The Sciences of the Artificial,” [6] the aspiring computational philosopher should have a deep appreciation for the relationship between math and science. I don’t think I could cover it any better than Feynman in [lecture 2 - On the relation of Math and Physics][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd0xTfdt6qw] of his 7 lecture series at Cornell - [The Character of Physical Law][7]. To summarize though, Math, in isolation, has many good reasons to follow the axiomatic + formal systems approach it has shifted to since the 20th century. Math used as a formal tool to describe complex phenomenon, however is not best used by starting axioms up but rather starting “somewhere in the middle.” For example, Maxwell’s equations serve as an elegant basis for a good subset of physics but is quite far removed from the axioms of modern math.</p>

<p>[6] despite its known shortcomings e.g. as discussed in Fred P. Brooks’s <em>The Design of Design</em>
[7] Combined on [Microsoft Tuva][http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/index.html] or individually 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3mhkYbznBk 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd0xTfdt6qw 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6n0HSJ5jEE 4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ6o1cDxV7o 5: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIOfOiZyQ3U 6: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAgcqgDc-YM 7: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIN_-Flswy0</p>

<p>We need a philosophy (of computation) before we can express even more formally and succinctly a math (of computation). We need to know what a good “middle ground” is to describe the phenomenon of computation lest we burden ourselves by describing computation starting with Peano arithmetic or Goedel numbers.</p>

<h1 id="on-computation-vs-computer-science">On computation vs <em>Computer Science</em></h1>

<p>The computer is simply an artifact we have crafted - a particular instance of the phenomenon of computation. We can observe the phenomenon of computation - the duality between process and information, behaviour and data, unfold almost everywhere in the physical world. We see it in how all living cells go about carrying out their actions with complex structures aimed at protecting, replicating, and distributing highly organized information coded as sequences of nucleic acids. We see it in expressed as intuitionistic understanding of impermanence and illusion of reality in traditions such as Buddhism. Even in the parts of physics we can’t yet explain, there seems to be a duality between how we’re able to describe the world in one instant as an organization of particles (data) and the process of how the physical world behaves to unfold its next configuration.[7]</p>

<p>[7] Goedel Escher Bach (Hofstaddter) and Process and Reality (Whitehead) both go in-depth into frameworks for thinking about data, ascribing meaning to organized / structured symbols, process (how infinite processes can be described by finite data and vice versa), and how we <em>prehend</em> our experience of being and becoming.</p>
